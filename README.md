# Noxasch Blog

This is [noxasch blog](https://noxasch.tech/blog/) rewritten in svelte except there are no actual post.
This only used as an experiment platform to add new feature faster.

## Future Development

This blog will be converted into elder.js.

## Development

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
